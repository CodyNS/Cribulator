# Cribulator
A cribbage calculator that keeps all sorts of interesting info about your games of crib with another person. For now, this is going to be set up to be used for myself and my friend. Might develop this more later if there's interest (lol).

To use, rename test_(blank)_save_data.txt  to  cribulator_player_save_data.txt,
compile with g++ (use the -std=c++11  flag if needed),
and play away.

You might want to rename the two players (only works for two players) from "Molly" and "Johnny" to match your situation ;)
